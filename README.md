## ‚ú® Features

- **Download Instagram Videos:** Input an Instagram video URL to fetch and
  download the video file. (Note: Functionality depends on the backend
  implementation, which isn't detailed here but is a core part of the learning
  experience).
- **Modern Frontend Stack:** Built with the latest Next.js (App Router).
- **Clean UI:** User interface crafted using [Shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/)
  components and styled with Tailwind CSS v4.
- **Responsive Layout:** Ensures a consistent and user-friendly experience
  across different screen sizes.
- **Type-Safe:** Written entirely in TypeScript.
- **Form Handling & Validation:** Robust input handling using React Hook Form
  and Zod for schema validation.
- **Client-Side Caching:** Efficient data fetching and state management with
  TanStack Query (React Query).
- **Theming:** Supports light and dark mode using `next-themes`.
- **English Interface:** Clean, user-friendly English-only interface.
- **User Feedback:** Uses `sonner` for toast notifications.
- **Optimized Development:** Utilizes Next.js Turbopack (`--turbopack`) for
  faster development builds.

## üìö Educational Goals

This project serves as a learning resource for understanding:

- **Next.js Fundamentals:** App Router, Server Components, Client Components,
  API Routes (if implemented for backend logic), SSR/SSG concepts.
- **UI Development:** Building composable and accessible UI components with
  Shadcn/ui, Radix UI primitives, and Tailwind CSS utility classes.
- **State Management:** Managing server state, caching, and background updates
  with TanStack Query.
- **Form Management:** Implementing complex forms with validation using React
  Hook Form and Zod.
- **API Integration:** Fetching data from external sources or custom backend
  endpoints. (The specifics of interacting with Instagram are a key learning
  challenge).
- **TypeScript:** Leveraging static typing in a full-stack React framework.
- **Modern Styling:** Using Tailwind CSS v4 features and utilities like `clsx`
  and `tailwind-merge`.
- **Clean Interface:** Building intuitive and accessible user interfaces.
- **Project Structure & Tooling:** Organizing a Next.js application, using
  ESLint and Prettier for code quality.
